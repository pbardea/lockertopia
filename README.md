lockertopia
===========
A site that allows you to manage class and clubs.

Once your account has been created, groups can be created. Groups will fall into one of 3 categories: classes, clubs or sports teams. Then other users can be added to these groups. Once other users are members, those users can see any announcements, projects or homework that have been assigned to them from that group.
All information in stored in a MySQL database (for which the template is the lockertopia.sql file in the main directory.)

Database information is in studfunctions.php

Setup:
---
1. Clone
2. Import lockertopia.sql to import directory structure.
3. Change credentials in studfunctions.sql

Note: Created March 2012. I've tried to fix what hasn't been working and it seems to be working currently, but feel free to submit an issue if any bugs are found.
